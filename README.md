<H6>RAG-Based Query Suggestion Chatbot with Chain of Thought for WordPress Sites</H6>
This project implements a versatile, intelligent chatbot for WordPress sites, leveraging advanced NLP techniques and state-of-the-art models. The chatbot uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Hugging Face Transformers, Sentence-BERT embeddings, Faiss vector databases, and a Chain of Thought (CoT) module to provide contextually relevant and logically consistent responses.
